Temperature Control

This project is a temperature controller for an electric heater
and a fan for a conservatory using an ATmega48.

The microcontroller reads two 1-Wire temperature sensors DS18B20 from MAXIM,
displays the values and switches the heater and the fan depending
on user settable thresholds. The first sensor is situated near
the ceiling of the conservatory, the other near the floor.
The heater is switched on if one of the two measured temperatures
falls below the lower threshold and switched off if the upper threshold
is reached.
The fan is switched on or off depending on the difference between
the two temperatures, to circulate the air in the conservatory.

Two 3 1/2 digit 7 segment LED displays are used to display the temperatures,
and four buttons to navigate through the menus to set the thresholds and view
recent temperature levels. The buttons are connected to a resistor ladder and
read via the integrated ADC.
The user thresholds are stored in the EEPROM inside the AVR.

The code for reading the 1-Wire sensors is taken from the MAXIM AppNote AN187
and the datasheet of the DS18B20.
There is also some unused code to measure the temperatures through the
integrated ADC and resistive temperature sensors (e.g. KTY series),
but the conversion from voltage to temperature is not implemented.

The project is created with AVR-Studio 4 (just for programming the AVR),
and I use eclipse and WinAVR-20100110 to edit and compile it.
There are two circuit diagrams, created with Target3001!, in TempCtrl.pdf.
The first page contains the microcontroller and the mains section,
the second page the display section.

Almost all comments and the PDF documents are in german, well, because I'm german
and I created this project for my parents.
I just thought, someone might find it useful, too :-)
